👋 Hi, I'm Andy Pham-Nguyen  
📊 Data Analyst | Machine Learning & Analytics Professional | Quality Systems Specialist  

I'm a data-driven professional transitioning from the biotech/biopharma quality space into data analytics and machine learning. With experience in GMP/GDP environments, QA/QC operations, investigations, and master data systems, I bring a strong analytical and process-driven mindset to data science projects.

I specialize in turning complex datasets into actionable insights through Python, SQL, statistical analysis, and machine learning models.

I’m currently open to **Data Analyst, Business Analyst, and Junior Data Scientist roles (full-time, hybrid, or remote)**.
