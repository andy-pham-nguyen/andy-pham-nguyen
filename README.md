👋 Hi, I'm Andy Pham-Nguyen
🌟 Aspiring Data Analyst | Quality Systems Professional | Lifelong Learner

I'm a data-driven professional transitioning from the biotech/biopharma quality space into data analytics. With hands-on experience in GMP/GDP environments, QA/QC operations, LIMS/gLIMS systems, investigations, and master data, I’ve developed a strong analytical mindset that I now apply through Python, SQL, dashboards, and end-to-end data projects.

I enjoy transforming messy, complex datasets into clear insights that drive smarter decisions — whether improving quality processes, understanding customer behavior, or optimizing business performance.

I’m currently open to Data Analyst and Business Analyst roles (full-time, hybrid, or remote) and eager to contribute to impactful, data-driven teams.
